    <p>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was
      developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the
      brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
